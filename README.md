* Hi there! My name is Ritik Pradhan.
* I am interested in programming, math, and going outside (believe it or not). I know mostly Python, C++, and Regex (if you count that as a language), but I have coded in other languages such as C. I mostly make games, AIs, and web scraping programs.
* I am currently learning about Chess Programming topics such as NNUE and Monte Carlo Tree Search to make my Chess AI.
* You can contact me with my email, flipit001@gmail.com
